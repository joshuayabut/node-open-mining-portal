    <p class="q">

      <b>Why Does my ZCL/BTCP Balance seem inaccurate for the time I have been mining?</b></p>
    <p class="q">
      The current blocks have to confirm fully ( After 100 Confirmations ) Then payments are processed and your balance will update accordingly. Please see the <a href="https://fund.zclassic.org/stats">Graph Stats</a> Page and look at current blocks found, blocks must be fully confirmed before payment processing occurs.</p>

    <p class="q">
      <strong>Why do I keep getting an Unauthorized or Authorization failed error message?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="q">
      You must to use a T address as the user in your mining program; you cannot use a Z address or an exchange address. Also make sure that the address is valid, as most authorization errors have been due to mistyping the address or case-sensitivity. Simply copy and paste whole T address for best results, and double-check your address. Your address can be in the format of ( T_address.workername ) for your miner.
